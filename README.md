# Let Other Randoms Do It - LORDI

Let Other Randoms Do It, aka LORDI - a platform for those who need small, one-off, paid services (clients), and those who are ready to provide said services (workers, "randoms", as they are called internally). The main goal is to provide an easy way for them to find each other, for them to connect with each other and, in the end, reach a desired outcome, being it finding a small paid work for a few hours or someone to complete such work.

It is accomplished through advertisements, **Requests** for something to be done or **Offers** of certain services, which can be posted by both clients and randoms. Those advertisements contain work description, location where it is supposed to happen and contact information of the person posted it. Users are able to view all the posted advertisements in order to find the one that suits them.
